        <br>
        <br>Today the desktop browser is still the easiest way to buy online, which is why it represented 89.5% of online commerce in 2015. And what about native apps? There’s nothing easy about downloading an app to purchase an item you discovered through a Google search or promotional email. Apps have failed to deliver results for the average retailer. There’s a short list of companies we buy from often, including Amazon, Walmart, and perhaps Target. For others, we don’t want another icon on our home screens.
        <br>
        <br>But by 2017, mobile browsers will be the easiest way to buy a product from the average retailer. Every product purchase will be a thumbprint away, with a buying experience as simple as Amazon’s today. All on the device that is always with you whenever you get the impulse to buy.At Moovweb we call this Thumbprint Checkout. Thumbprint Checkout will be the biggest improvement to the online shopping experience since online commerce itself. As with mobile commerce and eCommerce before it, this new technology represents an opportunity to leapfrog your competitors. To harness these benefits effectively will require a willingness to reevaluate past assumptions with an open mind and approach your checkout from a new perspective.</p>
      <p class="mnp">You need to implement Thumbprint Checkout before your 2016 Black Friday code freeze. You do not want 2017’s Black Friday to be the first in which you have Thumbprint Checkout; you want that to be the second year and benefit from all the learnings and analytics from the previous year.
        <br>
        <br>This whitepaper is a business person’s guide to implementing Thumbprint Checkout the right way. For simplicity, we will focus on Apple Pay for the web (APW) although everything would also apply to Android Pay for the web.</p>
      <h2 class="titleh2">What is Thumbprint Checkout?</h2>
      <p class="mnp">Thumbprint Checkout is Apple Pay and Android Pay for the web. In the product page integration depicted above in Figure 1, the flow is simple. First, the shopper visits a product page, clicks the “Buy with Apple Pay” button. Then they are shown the Payment Sheet, which is pre-populated with most information required to checkout. The sheet is shown by the browser, not the webpage contained within the browser. The shopper confirms the details and then applies a thumbprint (Touch ID on iOS) or a simple tap/swipe in the case of Android. That’s it!</p>
      <h2 class="titleh2">Eight steps to nailing Thumbprint Checkout</h2>
      <p class="mnp">Designing and building the right Thumbprint Checkout is not a simple task. To assist, we’ve simplified the entire process into the eight more important steps. Keep in mind, this is not a technical description of how Apple Pay should be implemented for the web. There is good developer documentation for that and the Apple- and Android-specific integration steps are simple once the product, business, and engineering teams have decided what to build through the eight steps below.</p>
      <h4>Step 1: Shed the past! Design with only the shopper experience in mind</h4>
      <p class="mnp">Constructing a new Thumbprint Checkout is a wonderful opportunity to shed all decisions of the past. Years ago, you may have had a simple checkout process. In addition to numerous usability issues, some listed above, many of today’s top 100 retailers have added a dizzying array of upsells, warranties, loyalty programs, promotions, shipping offers, and payment types. Over the years we have added so many new buzz features and checkout gadgets. All these features were probably tested to have shown some incremental value, but in the process, the most important constituent was forgotten—the shopper.</p>
      <p class="mnp">Encourage your team and peers to ask the ‘why’ or ‘what’ questions, not the ‘how’ questions. Your team will want to quickly jump to ‘how’ questions such as “if Apple’s Payment Sheet only provides a zip code prior to a thumbprint, and our current shipping and tax calculator API requires a full address, how can we return the right shipping costs?” These technical discussions are important, but if they are the starting point of the discussion, it will be easy to justify implementing Apple Pay as a simple payment option on the billing page.
        <br>
        <br>Rather encourage ‘why’/ ‘what’ questions, “why do we have so many options during checkout?” “What would shoppers feel if we if we removed promotion codes for thumbprint purchases?” “What is the absolute basic amount of customer information we need to complete a purchase?”</p>
      <h4>Step 2: Put the Apple Pay button on the product page!</h4>
      <div><img class="figure2img" src="images/4wc9e--l.png">
        <h5 class="captionsh5">Figure 2: Three integration options for Thumbprint Checkout</h5>
      </div>
      <p class="mnp">The most radical implementation of Thumbprint Checkout is on the product page. We strongly suggest you start with that approach—versus the cart or billing page options— because it represents the simplest purchase path for the shopper (i.e., skip the cart step as well as the checkout flow). And for your organization, it represents a chance to completely rethink the checkout flow and question all assumptions. If the “Buy with Apple Pay” button is on the product page, collecting promotion codes or offering warranty upsells becomes much more challenging. Where in the UI do you present such options? Do you have an API to support showing such options on the product page?
        <br>
        <br>Start with the product page integration unless less than 25% of your orders are for a single item (e.g., online groceries) in which case start with the cart integration.</p>

        <h5 class="captionsh5 figure3">Figure 3: Pros and Cons of each integration option</h5>
      </div>
      <p class="mnp">Figure 3 summarizes the pros and cons of each integration option. Remember, none of these are mutually exclusive and it’s best to eventually support all three. But in a time crunch to get Apple Pay for the web live by the 2016’s Black Friday, trade-offs may need to be made. Go through the design effort of thinking about integrating Apple Pay at the product page. Even if you decide to defer that implementation because you don’t think you’ll hit the 2016 Black Friday code freeze, you’ll have framed the exercise in the right way.</p>
      <h4>Step 3: Handle only the simplest use case</h4>
      <p class="mnp">Thumbprint Checkout is for all shoppers but not necessarily all use cases. The best use case is when shoppers like a single product and want to buy it as quickly as possible. They may be responding to a retargeted ad and like the holiday discount price of a product they’ve seen before. There are dozens of other examples. These shoppers are not browsing, they are ready to buy now (or from someone else’s site if yours is not not easy enough).</p>
      <p class="mnp">Remember, long-form checkout is still available to handle all other customer use cases—for folks who are assembling a large cart (and have multiple shipping addresses), who want to pay in installments, or apply or earn loyalty points, etc. Make sure the shopper is aware of those features when they don’t see them in the thumbprint flow. That way you are able to make the thumbprint flow as simple as possible. Option 1, the product page integration, forces simplicity. For example, where are you going to put the promo code field?</p>
      <p class="mnp">Make every effort to eliminate all unnecessary fields and features. Examples are promo code fields, product add-ons/upsells/cross-sells, multiple shipping addresses, and dozens of others. Moovweb has a rich taxonomy of all checkout features which can be found here (user: moovweb; password: widgets). Very few of these fields and features are actually required to consummate a purchase.</p>
      <p class="mnp">What should you have left? Only those things you need (not want) from the customer to make a purchase. For example, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM is a gifting site, they might decide that a gifting message is a required input, the vast majority of their customers want to personalize that message for the recipient. In that case, that field will have to show up on the product page right after the user clicks the “Buy with Apple Pay” button but before the native Payment Sheet is shown. Now what if they had two or three or more required fields. They could ask for that, but they’d be adding more hurdles for someone who is clearly ready to buy. Again, ask the 'what' question—what is the basic amount of customer information we need to complete the purchase?</p>
      <h4>Step 4: Understand the Apple Payment Sheet</h4>
      <p class="mnp">Thumbprint Checkout centers around the Payment Sheet. It’s power, in the case of Apple, is that Apple has 600M active accounts for which they have the most important elements required for checkout: contact info (name, email address, and phone number), shipping address, and payment information. To put this number in perspective, Apple has <a class="links" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-apple-has-600-million-accounts-blowing-away-every-other-company-2013-11">nearly three times</a> the number of accounts as the largest eCommerce company, Amazon, and nearly twice the number of accounts as the free social networking site Twitter. <a class="links" target="_blank" href="http://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">69% of mobile shoppers abandon</a> at some point of the process of pecking in that information. Now imagine they can skip that with a simple thumbprint!</p>
